<h2>FROM THIS WEEKS BANGIN' SECTION</h2>
<h3>Stella's - 4.5/5</h3>
<p>Stella's is a Greek-inspired restaurant that serves up some truly excellent dishes. The moussaka, in particular, is a must-try. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, and the service is friendly and attentive. Prices can be a bit steep, but it's well worth it for the quality of food.</p>

<h3>The Roosevelt - 4/5</h3>
<p>The Roosevelt is a great spot for brunch or dinner, with an upscale Southern menu that's sure to please. The fried chicken and biscuits are a standout dish, and the cocktail menu is impressive. The only downside is that the restaurant can get quite loud, so it's not the best spot for a quiet meal.</p>

<h3>Alewife - 4.5/5</h3>
<p>Alewife is a seafood-focused restaurant that serves up some truly delicious dishes. The oysters are particularly noteworthy, as is the crab dip. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate, with dim lighting and a well-stocked bar. Prices are on the higher side, but the quality of the food justifies it.</p>

<h3>Kreggers - 3.5/5</h3>
<p>Kreggers is a great spot for a casual meal or a night out with friends. The menu is fairly typical bar fare, with burgers and sandwiches taking center stage. The food is good, but not exceptional. Prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is relaxed and fun.</p>

<h3>East Coast Provisions - 4/5</h3>
<p>East Coast Provisions is a great spot for a boozy brunch or a fancy dinner out. The menu is seafood-focused, with oysters and crudos taking center stage. The restaurant has a sleek, modern atmosphere, and the service is friendly and attentive. Prices can be a bit steep, but the quality of food justifies it.</p>

<h3>Overall Score: 4/5</h3>
<p>Richmond has a fantastic food scene, with plenty of great options for any occasion. While there are some standout spots, like Stella's and Alewife, there are also some more casual options, like Kreggers, that are worth a visit.
